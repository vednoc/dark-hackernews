Customizable Stylus theme for HackerNews.

## Installation
To go further you'll need a CSS injector extension for your browser. We highly recommend [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) since it's simply the best one out there.

### Get Stylus:
Get the extension for [Firefox][amo], [Chrome][cws] and [Opera][aoe].

[amo]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/
[cws]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne
[aoe]: https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/

### Install this theme:
